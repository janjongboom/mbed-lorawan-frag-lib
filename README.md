# This library has been superseded by [mbed-lorawan-update-client](https://github.com/janjongboom/mbed-lorawan-update-client)

Implementation of Low-Density Parity-Check coding for forward error correction, plus crypto plugins to do verification of firmware updates. All files integrate with the Mbed `BlockDevice` interface, to prevent loading large blobs into memory. Based on the work by Arm, The Things Network and Semtech.

* `fragmentation\FragmentationSession.h` - LDPC frontend.
* `fragmentation\FragmentationMath.h` - LDPC implementation.
* `fragmentation\FragmentationBlockDeviceWrapper.h` - LDPC block device helper for unaligned operations.
* `crypto\FragmentationCrc64.h` - CRC64 implementation.
* `crypto\FragmentationEcdsa.h` - ECDSA implementation.
* `crypto\FragmentationSha256.h` - SHA256 implementation.
* `crypto\FragmentationRsaVerify.h` - RSA public key verification implementation.

## Usage

For a demonstration on using these classes to create a firmware update service with forward error correction, see [lorawan-fragmentation-in-flash](https://github.com/janjongboom/lorawan-fragmentation-in-flash).

## Memory usage

All memory is dynamically allocated on the heap, so you can unload heap objects when you start a data fragmentation session.

The amount of memory required for the algorithm depends on:

* Number of fragments required for a full file (without the redundancy packets) (`nbFrag`).
* The size of a data fragment (`fragSize`).
* The maximum number of redundancy frames that are expected (`nbRedundancy`).

Memory required can be calculated via:

```js
  ((nbRedundancy / 8) * nbRedundancy) // matrixM2B
+ (nbFrag * 2)                        // missingFrameIx
+ (nbFrag)                            // matrixRow
+ (fragSize)                          // matrixDataTemp
+ (nbRedundancy * 3)                  // tempVector, tempVector2 and s
```

For a 100K firmware image, split in 201 byte fragments with 200 redundancy packets this comes down to ~7.331 bytes:

```js
fragSize = 201;
nbFrag = (100 * 1024 / fragSize | 0) + 1;
nbRedundancy = 200;

// ((nbRedundancy / 8) * nbRedundancy) + (nbFrag*2) + (nbFrag) + (fragSize) + (nbRedundancy * 3)
// 7331 bytes
```

In addition:

* Some small allocations are made when xor'ing lines while applying the redundant packets.
* The FragmentationSession and FragmentationMath objects take up some space as well.
* Your flash driver probably needs to allocate a buffer the size of it's page size (unless memory is directly addressable).

On a Multi-Tech xDot you probably want to limit the number of redundancy frames to <100, given that an xDot running the Dot-Examples OTA_EXAMPLE has 7040 bytes of free heap space available.
